Now to check whether everything is properly installed or not run the code i have uploaded
in my git project named as firstml.py
copy the code in your anaconda navigator and run it.


The important thing is :
to analyse your code using any other data sheets or text files or csv files.....
keep all your data files which you may use to analyse from in the folder where your anaconda folder is created.

For example:
My anaconda is installed in Downloads Folder.
So keep all your data files which will be used as an input to analyse and process on in downloads folder.
Its better you create a folder named anything...like i named it as "ml" in Downloads Folder.
keep all your data files in ml folder.
While importing those data files in your code....just simply give the folder name followed by file name.
for example:
in my case it is "ml\pimaindiansdiabetes.csv" instead of giving "C:\Users\SHREYASI\ml\pimaindiansdiabetes.csv"

if you give complete path it will show error.



FINALLY....If you correctly followed the steps....the your code will definitely run without any error.

THANK YOU

For any query ping me..
