Open the Start menu, start typing "environment" and select the option called Edit the system environment variables
Select the Environment Variables button near the bottom
In the top section containing user variables, select the one called Path and choose to edit it
Create a new variable in the Path category under USER VARIABLES whose name refers to the location of the "Scripts" folder,
which is inside whichever folder you chose to install Anaconda.

For example:
I have my anaconda folder installed in downloads folder named as Anaconda3.
Inside it there is a folder Scripts..enter into the folder.
copy the entire path and paste it to tha Path category of USER VARIABLES through environment variables.

Then if type Anaconda prompt in search bar of windows you can see the anaconda prompt coming.
Click on it and then prompt opens.

Good luck to install deeplearning with cpu support.
